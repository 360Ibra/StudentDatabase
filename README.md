# StudentDatabase
 Project Unfinished still in progress
Backend functionality seems to be working all right features allow for a Student to Enter there ID and name and DOB and then submits to a MySql Database using jdbc Driver.
Once there is data in the database 

Things I plan on improving on this project:
Frontend side of the project 
Implementing a better search
Fixing DOB 

Ultimate end goal:
Make it more of an attractive experience for users to interact with
